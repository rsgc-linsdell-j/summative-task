# Summative Task

## Overall goal

My summative task will be to create a playable simulation of the theory of endosymbiosis.

The player starts off as a prokaryotic cell, containing only a nucleus. You traverse the water of a bog containing aerobic proteobacterium and cyanobacterium, as well as harmful parasitic bacterium. The goal for the cell is to absorb multiple aerobic proteobacterium and cyanobacterium in the hopes of becoming a eukaryotic cell.

The cell will be guided using the mouse on the computer. The two non-agressive bacterium will move randomly, and the parasitic bacterium will travel towards the cell slowly.


## Sub-goals

* extend Mover class I made for Brick Breaker to create the controllable cell
* extend the Bouncer class to create all of the other bacterium, however, unlike the Bouncer they will not bounce off objects, they will be absorbed
* use vectors to move all of the different cells around the screen
* harmless bacteria move randomly
* harmful bacteria move slowly towards the main cell
