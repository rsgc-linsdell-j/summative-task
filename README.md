# Summative Task

## Overall goal

My summative task will be to create a playable simulation of the theory of endosymbiosis.

The player starts off as a prokaryotic cell, containing only a nucleus. You traverse the water of a bog containing aerobic proteobacterium and cyanobacterium, as well as harmful parasitic bacterium. The goal for the cell is to absorb multiple aerobic proteobacterium and cyanobacterium in the hopes of becoming a eukaryotic cell.

The cell will be guided using the mouse on the computer. The two non-agressive bacterium will move randomly, and the parasitic bacterium will travel towards the cell slowly.


## Sub-goals

* extend Mover class I made for Brick Breaker to create the controllable cell
* extend the Bouncer class to create all of the other bacterium, however, unlike the Bouncer they will not bounce off objects, they will be absorbed
* use vectors to move all of the different cells around the screen
* harmless bacteria move randomly
* harmful bacteria move slowly towards the main cell

## Game Information

This game is based off the theory of endosymbiosis, which describe how the first eukaryotic cells came to be. It is theorized that a prokaryotic cell would have engulfed cyanobacterium and proteobacterium due to the prokaryote trying to prey on the bacterium, or the bacterium being parasitic. Once absorbed the bacterium manage to avoid digestion and survuve within the cytoplasm. The new bacterium then carrys out its normal functions. Cyanobacterium go through photosynthesis to create energy. Proteobacterium use air to create energy. The cell then uses the energy created by the bacterium for its processes. Eventually the bacterium become part of the cell and are considered to be organelles, and the cell is considered to be a eukaryotic cell.
